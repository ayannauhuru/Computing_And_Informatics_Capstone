# CICapstone2022
A website built as a final group project for the Computing and Informatics Capstone 2022 course. My group created a travel website for Berlin, Germany. For my part of the project, I created a webpage with a list of popular museums in Berlin, their locations, and ratings. I connected to the Google Maps API and parsed its JSON data using the R language. Using MySQL, phpMyAdmin, and XAMPP, I created and connected to our shared database to store the data. We built our website using PHP and I created a basic format and design using HTML and CSS.

We had six web pages that included: a home page, popular museums (my page), COVID-19 case information, stadium reviews, a weather report, and a German to English language translator.
